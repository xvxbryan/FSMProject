Software Engineering Finite State Machine Project.
This project was a group project for my software engineering class.
The purpose is to make a tool that is useful for students taking Theory of Algorithms.
It allows the user to create their own finite state machines and test different input strings to see if the state machine accepts or rejects the string.
